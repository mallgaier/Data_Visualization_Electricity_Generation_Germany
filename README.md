## Features
- __Generation__ broken down by source
- __Consumption__ in Germany
- __Import / Export__ with the neighboring countries
- __CO2 Equivalent__ per kWh on average
- From __2015 to 2022__ in 15min-intervals

## Utilize several views to explore the data
- __Data Explorer__: Explore the electricity production from several viewpoints through a timeline
__Timeline Comparison__: Compare two timelines of electricity production which each other.
- __Heatmap__: Discover the percentage contribution of each electricity source, broken down by weekdays, to the total production. Or use the heatmap to display the emissions in CO2-Equivalent per weekday.
- __Scatterplot__: Identify the correlation of two variables, divided by years or seasons, using a custom-build scatterplot
- __Price and Export__: Understand how the day-ahead price is related to the amount of electricity imported / exported.
